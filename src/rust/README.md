Rust

- [C like](./c-like.md)
- [Error](./rust-error.md)
- [Struct](./struct.md)

Notion
=======

- `mut` , all variables are `const`, to make it `modifiable` added the `mut`
- `Result` of a `.method_name()` is an `enum`.
- We call each possible state of `Result` a `variant`.
- `Result`'s `variants` for `.read_line()` are `Ok` and `Err`.
- The blocks of code after `if`: called arms `{}`
- `let mut s="jjj"` not allowed,
- `let mut s=String::from("jjj")` allowed using the heap mÃ©moire
-  `let s2 = s1`: `s1` `move` to `s2`, then `s1` will be droped


re-use Var: shadows
--------------------
```rust
let x=10;
let x="ll";
```
- `mut` not allowing the shadows
```rust
let mut x=10
x="ll";

```
variables
=========
```rust
let x : i32= 4; // u32,u8..
let x : i32= 4_000; // 4_000 == 4000

let y: f32 = 3.0; // defualt is f64
let floored = 2 / 3; // Results in 0

let t: bool = false;

let heart_eyed_cat: char = 'ðŸ˜»';// 'z' ...should use single for char
```

Tuple
=====
```rust
let tup:(i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1.5);
let (x, y, z) = tup;
println!("The value of z is: {z} or {} or {tup.2} or {}",tup.2); // {tup.2} -> not allowed
```
Arr
====

Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike
arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.
```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let first = a[0];
```

What Is Ownership?
==================

Memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the
compiler checks. If any of the rules are violated, the program wonâ€™t compile.
None of the features of ownership will slow down your program while itâ€™s
running.
- Ownership Rules
    - Each value in Rust has an owner.
    - There can only be one owner at a time.
    - When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
- the error `double free error` is solved by `shallow copy`

`shallow copy`: not drop the `heap data` of `var` if this `data` shared between
another `var`
- `deep copy`, `s1` and `s2` will be separated
```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();
```
- types that used head memory used move and other used copy function
```rust
    let s = String::from("hello");
    takes_ownership(s);
    s:String("new"); // not allowed because moved from this scope
```
